<img src="Articles/3.JPEG"alt="right" align="right" height="300" width="400" border="20">
<p>Hello to everyone reading this! I’m here with great news to spend your free time to learn some pretty good things at home during this boring quarantine.
</p><br>
<p>You must have seen the tips to make these days productive, almost everywhere and here is SPADE, a tier 5 student organization with an event to actually make your quarantine productive. I know you must be thinking that LPU is still conducting events? Well, yes! But online, just like your classes now. It is quite good by the way because you are still going to get non-academic exposure and good academic-related events like workshops, guests lecture maybe!
</p><br>
<p>Okay, now coming to the event that SPADE is organizing, it is an online workshop organized to learn and get introduced to various technical and marketing fields. The name of the event is ‘Spade Ki Pathshala – Online Webinars from 5th-10th April. This will include Website Designing, Graphic Designing, Amazon Alexa, Laravel 6.0 Basic, Marketing and Digital Marketing. This is great, especially for the beginners and the ones in dilemma whether to go for that particular course or not or simply for the ones who are unable to choose the best one for them.
