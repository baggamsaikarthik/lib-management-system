<p>AI and robotics are developed for mankind aid and human growth and this is seen clearly during the prevalence of COVID-19 across the globe. European countries and the United States are taking the help of the automation industry in performing tasks like hospital sanitation, food-medicine delivery and suspected area inspection where stepping of humans can be dangerous. Wuhan, the epicentre of this pandemic has opened a hospital with 14 robots for isolation and examining the patients. India is also preparing its automation and robotics for the COVID-19.
