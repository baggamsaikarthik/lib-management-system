<p>LPU’s DRT chosen among top 8 Startups in the world by International Astronautical Federation Committee
</p><br>    
<p>Just like Arjun whose only focus was eyes of fish simultaneously DRT’s focus lies in mapping the space debris with precision FOR SPACE.
</p><br>
<p>Lovely Professional University has been making a mark all around by ground-breaking inventions it has done its part. We have seen innovations like ZORoute – Cheapest One Way Intercity Taxi” to 100 % eco-friendly paint made from plant-based material but that’s not all. “2U CubeSat” has been the latest innovations by LPU research scholars with an aim to get rid of the space debris as small as 5 centimetres, which is equipped with laser ranger finder that maps and analyses the debris.
</p><br>
<p>In collaboration with Lovely Professional University, Digantara Research and Technologies, being a brainchild of Anirudh Sharma and Rahul Rawat, has taken strides in leaps and bounds to overcome 10,000 bits of Debris from Space through “2U CubeSat – Orbit Space Debris Monitor”. The DRT team consists of Sai Ganesh (23) who is the lead scientist and mission architect. Sikindar Vatturi (21), a mechanical engineering graduate from LPU is the chief designer and engineer. Tanveer Ahmed, a 21-year-old aerospace engineering student from RV College of Engineering who joined later is now leading the technical command of the company as CTO.
