<p>Coronavirus isn’t something that the world hasn’t heard of. Within just a small span of time, big countries around the world are on the verge of falling due to this deadly virus. Although scientists around the world are working on finding a cure, there has been an enlightening finding recently.
</p><br>
<p>Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is a vaccine that is given to children to help them develop resistance to Tuberculosis (TB). India has universal immunization laws and giving this vaccine to children who are just born or after their birth is mandatory in India. In countries like the United States, Italy, and the Netherlands, the BCG vaccine isn’t mandatory to give to children. Gonzalo Otazu, Assistant Professor of Biomedical Sciences at the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) has led a group of researchers who have talked about their findings. They believe that this BCG vaccine is a factor that differentiates the virus’s effect on Indians from the people around the world.
