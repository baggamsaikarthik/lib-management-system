<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px;font-family: Lucida Console;">LPU alumnus helping students amid the COVID-19 lockdown</h1><br>
<img src="Articles/1.JPEG"alt="right" align="right" height="300" width="400" border="20">
<p>The peace of our globe has been hindered by the deadly Coronavirus (COVID-19) recently which has shaken the normal lifestyle of people of major parts of the world, resulting in huge loss of lives. India being no exception is also facing major turbulence which forced the Indian government to initiate a lockdown making crores of the population to sit and stay at home. Due to the havoc created, LPU has halted all the classes making the majority of the hostellers leave their hostels but the students residing in the nearby areas of LPU are facing some significant problems.
</p><br>
<p>Even after the constant efforts of the University to eradicate all the difficulties for the students still staying in the hostels and the nearby areas, students are experiencing a hike in prices of the daily items causing a sense of insecurity among them. In such a situation, Mr. Avinash, an alumnus of LPU and also an entrepreneur, is helping students especially the ones living outside the campus with the availability of regular items at considerable price. Mr. Avinash whoâ€™s turning out to be a lifesaver for a bulk of students is working along with his brother to provide the students with all the required items including groceries, fruits, vegetables, milk and other eatable items at MRP without any extra charges
