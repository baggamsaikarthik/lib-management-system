<p>The device was tactfully developed using multiple sensors to detect the decaying items in the fridge. Sensors like volatile organic compound (VOC), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ammonia sensor and temperature and humidity monitor. Some of these sensors are not quite easily available in India and the team had to patiently search for them. Soon after the commencement of the idea in October 2015, with the help of their professor Mr Harshpreet Singh they successfully finished the product in May 2016.

<p>Dedication and passion-driven success

<p>There can be many products in the fridge, reading each and every item’s quality and duly notifying the owner might sound simple but practically very tough. Technically the product is all about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. These students were yet to learn those subjects when they began working. They stunned everyone through extensive research and self-study. After a prevailing success, there is no stopping, they say it’s time to strive for more improvements. The team is currently waiting for patent approval to hit the markets possibly in the next 3 years.
